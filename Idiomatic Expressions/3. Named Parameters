## Named Parameters

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main()
{
	size_t timeoutInSeconds = 1;
	const bool doNotRescheduleTimer = false;

	notifyClosingDoor = startTimer(timeoutInSeconds = 4, doNotRescheduleTimer);
	closeDoor = startTimer(timeoutInSeconds = 2, doNotRescheduleTimer);

	return 0;
}
```

Although this idiom seems like a good solution, most often it is just a bandaid for the root issues. Most examples for its applicability would be better solved by redesigning the code. This suggests that **Named Parameters** are more of a cool trick than a true idiomatic expression.
